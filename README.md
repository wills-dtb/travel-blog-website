Static Website on AWS

In this project, I've deployed a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.

Access it through this URL: https://willos-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html

The files included are: 
```
index.html - The Index document for the website.
/img - The background image file for the website.
/vendor - Bootssrap CSS framework, Font, and JavaScript libraries needed for the website to function.
/css - CSS files for the website.
```

For screenshots of the work, please see the files in the `/screenshots` directory
